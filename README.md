# Sidecar Client Fabric

Sidecar-client-fabric is the plugin implementation for fabric blockchain.

## How to build

Use the following command to build

```
make fabric1.4
```

This will create a `build` directory under the project path and generate a `fabric-client-1.4.so` inside the `build`.
This `.so` file will be used by [Sidecar](https://gitlab.33.cn/link33/sidecar).

## Usage
